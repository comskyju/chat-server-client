# Overview

For this project, the objective was to create an Instant Messaging program with a Server and a Client class. The clients should be able to communicate with each other through the Server, meaning that the use of threads is necessary. The server will be receiving every message sent by any client using sockets and then it will proceed to return it to all connected clients, which will then display said message on their respective chat areas.
